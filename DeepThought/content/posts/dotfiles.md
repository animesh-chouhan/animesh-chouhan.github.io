## Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

- Backup, restore, and sync the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.

- Learn from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.

- Share what youâ€™ve learned with the rest of us.

## Which dotfiles should I really manage on Github?

You can put .profile, .bashrc, .nvimrc, .vimrc and others on Github.

## How do you manage your dotfiles?

Here are the steps:

1. Make a repository named dotfiles on your Github.

2. Clone it in your home directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/dotfiles.git
   ```

3. Create hard links of the dotfiles you want to manage. Eg:

   ```bash
   ln ~/.bashrc ~/dotfiles/.bashrc
   ```

4. Commit and push to your repo.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "add dotfiles"
   git push
   ```

## Use my dotfiles

{{% alert note %}}
Warning: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

   cd dotfiles

This will create hard links of my dotfiles to your home directory.
