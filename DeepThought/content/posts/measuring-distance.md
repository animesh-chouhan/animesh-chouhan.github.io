## History of Length Measurement

The measurement of length has a long and varied history, dating back to ancient civilizations that developed standardized units to support trade, construction, and agriculture. The earliest recorded systems emerged in Mesopotamia and Egypt, where cubitsâ€”based on the length of a forearmâ€”were commonly used. In Ancient Rome, the foot (based on the human foot) became a standard unit, while in Ancient India, the dhanus(bow), the krosha and the yojana were widely employed.

Early measuring methods for length were based on the use of human body parts. Lengths and width of fingers, thumbs, hands, hand spans, cubits and body spans seem to have been popular choices.

</p>

Using body parts for measurement, as was common in ancient times, posed several significant issues. The primary challenge was the lack of standardization, as body parts vary significantly between individuals. This lack of uniformity hindered large-scale projects and international trade, where consistency was crucial.

The advent of the metric system in France during the late 18th century revolutionized length measurement by introducing a universal system based on the meter. This system gradually became the global standard, promoting international coherence in science, industry, and commerce.

Enough of history, let's explore an interesting problem now.

## The Explorer and the Rope

Once upon a time, a seasoned sea explorer found himself stranded on a remote island with nothing but a 10-meter rope and his wits. Far from civilization and stripped of his usual tools, he faced the daunting task of creating a reliable measurement system from scratch to build his ship to get back.

Suppose you are the explorer. How would you go about solving this problem?

**Hint:** Think about how you would measure distances like **20m, 25m, 32m, 41.5m** etc.

## Approach

**Given a 10-meter rope, what's the distance we can measure right away?**

Well, it is **10m** and we can also measure distances that are multiples like **20m**, **30m**, **40m** etc. 20 meters would be two rope lengths and so on. This approach is straightforward but limited in precision.

**What about measuring distance like 25 meters?**

If you want to measure a distance that isn't an exact multiple of your rope's length, you can divide the rope into smaller, equal sections to measure the remaining distance.

We can divide the rope in half by folding it giving us a measure of 5 meters and therefore we can now measure 25 meters:

}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  pre code {
      font-size: 0.9em
   }
}

</style>

$$D = 10 * 2 + 5$$

**How about measuring distances like 8.5m, 12.25m?**

We can further keep diving the rope in half to get the measure of 2.5m, 1.25m and so forth. But given these measures how can we accurately measure an arbitrary length like **23.426m**?

Let's look at the mathematical representation of this problem to find out the answers.

### Mathematical Representation

Let's represent the problem mathematically:

#### **Variables:**

- \\( L \\) = Full length of the rope
- \\( D \\) = Total distance to be measured
- \\( n \\) = Number of full lengths of the rope required to span most of the distance
- \\( r \\) = Remaining distance after using \\( n \\) full lengths of the rope

#### Algorithm:

1. **Initial Step: Use Full Rope Length:**

   $$
   n = \left\lfloor \frac{D}{L} \right\rfloor
   $$

   The remaining distance \\( r \\) is:

   $$
   r = D - n \cdot L
   $$

2. **Iterative Approximation Process:**

   Now by dividing the rope, we can measure distances like \\( \frac{L}{2} \\), \\( \frac{L}{4} \\), \\( \frac{L}{8} \\) and so forth.

   Let us represent the smaller divisions by \\(l_i\\) where:

   $$l_i = \frac{L}{2^i}$$

   Now, as \\(0 \le r < L\\) we can estimate \\( r \\) by using combinations of \\(l_i\\). Therefore,

   $$r\_{approx} = \frac{L}{2} \pm \frac{L}{4} \pm \frac{L}{8} \pm \frac{L}{16} \cdots$$

   **How can we be sure that this approximation covers the whole range?**

   First, let us try to analyze the minimum and maximum values that \\(r\_{approx}\\) can attain:

   > The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series can be expressed as:
   > $$S = \sum\_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n = \frac{a}{1 - r}$$
   >
   > where:
   >
   > - \\( a \\) is the first term,
   > - \\( r \\) is the common ratio, and \\( |r| < 1 \\).

   The minimum value is attained when all following terms are negative i.e.

   $$
   \displaylines{\begin{align} \min({r\_{approx}}) &= \frac{L}{2} - \frac{L}{4} - \frac{L}{8} - \frac{L}{16} \cdots \\\ &= \frac{L}{2} - \frac{L}{4}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} \\\ &= \frac{L}{2} - \frac{L}{4}*\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \\\ &= 0\end{align}}
   $$

   Similarly, the maximum value is attained when all following terms are positive i.e.

   $$
   \displaylines{\begin{align} \max({r\_{approx}}) &= \frac{L}{2} + \frac{L}{4} + \frac{L}{8} + \frac{L}{16} \cdots \\\ &= \frac{L}{2} + \frac{L}{4}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} \\\ &= \frac{L}{2} + \frac{L}{4}*\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \\\ &= L\end{align}}
   $$

   The proof that that this approximation covers the whole range is left as an exercise for the reader. <span class="chart">ðŸ˜‰</span>

   **Approximation:**

   We start by approximating \\( r \\) as \\( \frac{L}{2} \\). Therefore:

   $$
   r_0 = \frac{L}{2}
   $$

   For each iteration \\( i \\):

   - Divide the rope length by \\( k_i = 2^{i+1} \\):
     $$
     l_i = \frac{L}{2^{i+1}}
     $$
   - Calculate the error \\( Îµ \\):
     $$
     Îµ_i = r - r_i
     $$
   - Calculate the next direction to move on the number line \\( m\_{i+1} \\):
     $$
     m_{i+1} = \frac{{r - r_i}}{\left|{r - r_i}\right|} = \frac{{Îµ_i}}{\left|{Îµ_i}\right|}
     $$
   - The new approximation \\( r\_{i+1} \\) becomes:
     $$
     r_{i+1} = r_i + m_{i+1} \cdot l_{i+1}
     $$
   - If \\( Îµ_i \\) is small enough (i.e., less than the current precision threshold), stop the process.

     $$
     r \approx \frac{L}{2} + \sum\_{i=1}^{\text{max iterations}} m_i \cdot l_i
     $$

3. **Sum the Total Distance:**

   $$
   D \approx n \cdot L + \frac{L}{2} + \sum\_{i=1}^{\text{max iterations}} m_i \cdot l_i
   $$

### **Example:**

Suppose you have a rope of length \\( L = 8 \\) meters, and you need to measure a distance \\( D = 19 \\) meters.

1. **Step 1: Initial Full Lengths:**

   $$
   n = \left\lfloor \frac{11}{8} \right\rfloor = 2
   $$

   The distance covered is \\( 2 \cdot 8 = 16 \\) meters.

   $$
   r = 19 - 16 = 3 \text{ meters}
   $$

2. **Step 2: Initial approximation:**

   - Initial approximation: \\( r_0 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) meters.

3. **Step 2: First approximation:**

   - Initial approximation: \\( r_0 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) meters.
   - Error: \\( Îµ_0 = r - r_0 = 3 - 4 = -1\\)
   - Rope measure: \\( l_1 = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \\) meters.
   - Direction to move: \\( m_1 = \frac{{Îµ_0}}{\left|{Îµ_0}\right|} = -1 \\).
   - New approximation: \\( r_1 = 4 + (-1)\*2 = 2 \\) meter.

4. **Step 3: Second Approximation:**

   - Previous approximation: \\( r_1 = 2 \\) meter.
   - Error: \\( Îµ_1 = r - r_1 = 3 - 2 = 1\\)
   - Rope length: \\( l_2 = \frac{8}{8} = 1 \\) meters.
   - Direction to move: \\( m_2 = \frac{{Îµ_1}}{\left|{Îµ_1}\right|} = 1 \\).
   - New approximation: \\( r_2 = 2 + 1\*1 = 3 \\) meter.

5. **Step 4: Halt Approximation:**

   - Previous approximation: \\( r_2 = 3 \\) meter.
   - Error: \\( Îµ_2 = r - r_2 = 3 - 3 = 0\\)

   As the error is zero, we have successfully approximated the distance.

6. **Step 5: Total Distance Approximation:**

   $$
   \displaylines{\begin{align}D &\approx 2 \cdot 8 + 4 + 2 \cdot -1 + 1 \cdot 1 \\\ &= 16 + 4 - 2 + 1 \\\ &= 19 \text{ meters}\end{align}}
   $$

### **Precision:**

By halving the rope length at each step, you can continue this process until the remaining distance is negligible, providing an increasingly precise measurement. This method mirrors the binary search algorithm, where the solution space is progressively halved until the desired precision is reached.

This method allows you to measure distances more accurately using just the rope, without needing additional tools or scales.

## Python Implementation

```python
ERROR = 0.0001
MAX_ITERATIONS = 100


# distance < scale
def measure(distance, scale):
    iteration = 1
    y_prev = scale / 2

    if distance < ERROR:
        return distance, 0

    while iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS and abs(distance - y_prev) > ERROR:
        direction = 1 if (distance - y_prev) > 0 else -1
        y_next = y_prev + direction * (scale / pow(2, iteration + 1))
        iteration += 1
        y_prev = y_next

    return y_prev, iteration


def measure_repeated(distance, scale):
    full = int(distance / scale)
    remaining = distance - full * scale
    approx, iterations = measure(remaining, scale)
    return {"approximation": full * scale + approx, "iterations": full + iterations}

```

This code provides two main functions, `measure` and `measure_repeated`, which estimate values iteratively by measuring the distance in relation to a given `scale`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- **`measure`**: Uses an iterative approach with diminishing step sizes (halving each time) to approximate a given `distance` within a specified `ERROR` margin. It ensures that the approximation is as close as possible to the target within a reasonable number of iterations.

- **`measure_repeated`**: Enhances the `measure` function by handling larger distances that may consist of multiple full `scale` units plus a remainder. It efficiently breaks down the problem, approximates the remainder, and combines the results.

  <summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>

### Constants

```python
ERROR = 0.0001  # The allowable error threshold for stopping iterations
MAX_ITERATIONS = 100  # Maximum number of iterations to perform in the measurement
```

### Functions

#### 1. `measure(distance, scale)`

This function estimates the `distance` compared to the `scale`, aiming to converge to an accurate result within a margin of error.

##### Key Steps:

1. **Initialization**:

   - `iteration = 1`: Counter for the number of iterations.
   - `y_prev = scale / 2`: Initial guess, starting at half the `scale`.

2. **Early Exit**:

   - If `distance` is less than `ERROR`, the function returns the `distance` and `0` iterations because it's already within the error tolerance.

3. **Main Iterative Loop**:

   - The loop runs while the difference between `distance` and `y_prev` (the current approximation) is larger than the `ERROR`, and the iteration count is under the `MAX_ITERATIONS`.
   - The `direction` is determined as `1` if the current approximation (`y_prev`) is less than `distance` (i.e., you need to increase the guess), or `-1` if it overshoots.
   - The next approximation `y_next` is adjusted based on the previous guess, moving in the right `direction`, but reducing the step size as the iteration increases: `y_prev + direction * (scale / pow(2, iteration + 1))`.
   - After each iteration, the new approximation is stored in `y_prev`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the approximate result (`y_prev`) and the number of iterations it took.

#### 2. `measure_repeated(distance, scale)`

This function extends `measure` by handling cases where `distance` is greater than the `scale`. It breaks the `distance` into multiples of `scale`, then applies the `measure` function on the remainder.

##### Key Steps:

1. **Integer Division**:

   - `full = int(distance / scale)`: Calculates how many full `scale` units can fit into `distance`.
   - `remaining = distance - full * scale`: Calculates the remaining part after fitting the full scales.

2. **Measure on Remaining**:

   - The `measure` function is called on the `remaining` distance, providing an approximation for the remainder.

3. **Return Value**:
   - It returns a dictionary containing:
     - The total approximation: `full * scale + approx` (full scales plus the measured remainder).
     - The total iteration count: `full + iterations` (adding iterations for the remainder and the full-scale divisions).

</details>

### Usage Example:

```python
scale = 10

print(measure(5, scale))
print(measure(4.9, scale))

print(measure_repeated(10, scale))
print(measure_repeated(3.75, scale))
print(measure_repeated(9.8, scale))
```

Let's look at the output of this approximation algorithm:

```sh
animesh@pop-os:~$ python -u "measure.py"
(5.0, 1)
(4.89990234375, 12)
{'approximation': 10, 'iterations': 1}
{'approximation': 3.75, 'iterations': 3}
{'approximation': 9.7999572, 'iterations': 16}
```

</p>

## Convergence Analysis

In our initial approach, we repeatedly halved the rope length to achieve more precise measurements. But why didnâ€™t we divide it by 3 or even 4 instead?

Let's take a look at the generalized version of this approximation:

Given:

- \\( L \\) is the initial length of the rope.
- \\( \alpha \\) is the scaling factor that determines how much the rope length is reduced at each step.
- \\( D \\) is the total distance you want to measure.

The process involves measuring the distance using the rope, then successively reducing the ropeâ€™s length by the factor \\( \alpha \\) to measure any remaining distance more precisely.

### **Series Representation:**

The distance \\( D \\) measured after \\( k \\) steps can be represented as a sum:

$$
D_k = n \cdot L + (L \cdot \alpha) + m_1 \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^2) + \cdots + m_k \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+1})
$$

where:

- \\( n = \left\lfloor \frac{D}{L} \right\rfloor \\)
- \\( m_i \in \lbrace 1, -1\rbrace \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \dots, k \\)
- \\( m_i \\) is the coefficient of length \\( L \cdot \alpha^{i+1} \\) used to approximate the remaining distance.

Let's use the [Cauchy Ratio test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test) to perform the convergence test:

> The **Cauchy Ratio Test** is a method used to determine the convergence or divergence of an infinite series. It provides a criterion based on the ratio of successive terms in the series.
>
> Consider the infinite series:
>
> $$
> \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
> $$
>
> where \\( a_n \\) represents the \\( n \\)-th term of the series.
>
> The Cauchy Ratio Test examines the limit of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms:
>
> $$
> L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right|
> $$
>
> where \\( L \\) is the limit of the ratio.
>
> ### Conclusion Based on \\( L \\):
>
> 1. **\\( L < 1 \\)**:
>
> - The series converges absolutely. This means that the series \\( \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \\) converges, and so does the series \\( \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| \\).
>
> 2. **\\( L > 1 \\)**:
>
> - The series diverges. This means that the series \\( \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \\) does not converge.
>
> 3. **\\( L = 1 \\)**:
>
> - The test is inconclusive. The ratio test does not provide information about convergence or divergence when \\( L = 1 \\), and other methods must be used to determine the behavior of the series.

Consider the series:

$$
\sum\_{k=1}^{\infty} m_k \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+1})
$$

where \\( m_k \in \lbrace 1, -1\rbrace \\).

#### General Term

The general term of the series is:

$$
a_k = m_k \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+1}).
$$

and the \\( (k+1) \\)-th term is:

$$
a_{k+1} = m_{k+1} \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+2}).
$$

#### Calculating the ratio

Now, finding the ratio \\( \frac{a\_{k+1}}{a_k} \\):

$$
\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} = \frac{m_{k+1} \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+2})}{m_k \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+1})} = \frac{m_{k+1} \cdot \alpha^{k+2}}{m_k \cdot \alpha^{k+1}} = \alpha \cdot \frac{m_{k+1}}{m_k}
$$

The absolute value of the ratio is:

$$
\left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| = |\alpha| \cdot \left| \frac{m_{k+1}}{m_k} \right|.
$$

Since \\( m_k \\) and \\( m\_{k+1} \\) are either \\( 1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), \\( \left| \frac{m\_{k+1}}{m_k} \right| = 1 \\). Therefore:

$$
\left| \frac{a\_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| = |\alpha|.
$$

#### Conclusion

The Ratio Test evaluates that the series \\( \sum\_{k=1}^{\infty} m_k \cdot (L \cdot \alpha^{k+1}) \\) converges if **\\( |\alpha| < 1 \\)** as:

$$
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| = |\alpha|.
$$

Considering only the positive values of **\\(\alpha\\)** we conclude:

$$
\boxed{0 < \alpha < 1}
$$

### Convergence Visualization

We can try to visualize the convergence behaviour by modifying our Python script and using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot the graphs:

<p align="center">
   <img src="/images/posts/measuring-distance/error-iterations.png" alt="Error and Iterations" style="border-radius:12px;max-width:95%" onclick="this.requestFullscreen()"/>
</p>

#### Graph Interpretation

1. **Average Error vs Î±**:

   - The error decreases as \\( \alpha \\) increases from 0 to about 0.5, reaching a minimum.
   - Then the error starts increasing again as \\( \alpha \\) approaches 1.

2. **Average Iterations vs Î±**:
   - The number of iterations remains mostly constant for \\( \alpha \\) up to around 0.5.
   - Then it drops significantly, reaching a minimum around \\( \alpha = 0.5 \\), before increasing again as \\( \alpha \\) approaches 1.

The optimal \\( \alpha \\) (where both error is minimized and convergence is faster) seems to be around \\( \alpha = 0.5 \\)

#### Mathematical Interpretation

Let's take a look at the range of this general approximation and if it covers the whole range:

Let us represent the smaller divisions by \\(l_i\\) where:

$$l_i = {L}*{\alpha^i}$$

Now, we can estimate \\( r \\)(remaining distance) by using combinations of \\(l_i\\). Therefore,

$$r\_{approx} = L \cdot \alpha \pm L \cdot \alpha^2 \pm L \cdot \alpha^3 \pm L \cdot \alpha^4 \cdots$$

The minimum value is attained when all following terms are negative i.e.

$$
\displaylines{\begin{align} \min({r\_{approx}}) &= L \cdot \alpha - L \cdot \alpha^2 - L \cdot \alpha^3 - L \cdot \alpha^4 \cdots \\\ &= L \cdot \alpha - L \cdot \alpha^2\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha^{n} \\\ &= L \cdot \alpha - L \cdot \alpha^2*\frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \\\ &= L \cdot \alpha \cdot \frac{1 - 2\alpha}{1 - \alpha}\end{align}}
$$

Now we know that the minimum value that we need to approximate is 0. Therefore we have to solve the inequality:

$$
\frac{L \cdot \alpha \cdot (1 - 2\alpha)}{1 - \alpha} \leq 0
$$

> Since \\( 0 < \alpha < 1\\), it follows that \\( 0 < 1 - \alpha < 1\\).

The inequality reduces to:

$$
(1 - 2\alpha) \leq 0
$$

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{2} \leq \alpha < 1}
$$

Since the magnitude of the approximation error at pass \\(n\\) is limited by the current yardstick length (\\(L \* \alpha^n\\)), a smaller value of \\(\alpha\\) leads to fewer passes needed to achieve a given accuracy.

Therefore, to maximize efficiency, \\(\alpha\\) should be minimized (\\(\alpha = 0.5\\)), meaning the **yardstick length should be halved with each pass**.

### Critical Role of \\( \boldsymbol{\alpha} \\)

Let's look at the approximation visualization for various Î±:

<p align="center">
   <img src="/images/posts/measuring-distance/alpha-viz.png" alt="Visualization for various alpha" style="border-radius:12px;max-width:98%" onclick="this.requestFullscreen()"/>
</p>

The scaling factor \\( \alpha \\) directly influences how fast the rope length diminishes with each step. The smaller \\( \alpha \\) is, the faster the length of the rope reduces.

- **\\( \boldsymbol{\alpha < 0.5} \\):**
  The rope length decreases very quickly, potentially making the series converge too slowly, and in some cases, the approximation process might not adequately capture the remaining distance.
- **\\( \boldsymbol{\alpha = 0.5} \\):**
  The rope length decreases by half at each step. This is a convergent geometric series with a common ratio \\( \frac{1}{2} \\).

- **\\( \boldsymbol{\alpha > 0.5} \\):**
  The rope length decreases more slowly. The series still converges, but more slowly because the terms decrease less rapidly.

## Mission Accomplished <span class="chart">â›µ</span>

Utilizing the iterative approximation method, the sailor ingeniously developed a way to measure distances accurately despite the lack of conventional tools. As you consider his resourcefulness and problem-solving skills, I hope you enjoyed assisting him in solving this complex problem and navigating his way back to civilization.

## Limitations

While theoretically effective, the successive approximation method using a rope is ultimately limited by the human eyeâ€™s visual resolution, the flexibility of the rope, and the cumulative effect of small errors in measurement. These factors make it challenging to achieve high levels of precision, particularly when measuring very small distances.

The main limitation being the visual resolution of the eye. The human eye can only perceive differences in position down to about **0.1** to **0.2 millimeters** under optimal conditions. This is known as the **visual acuity limit**.

<p align="center">
   <img src="/images/posts/measuring-distance/snellen-chart.png" alt="Snellen Chart" style="border-radius:12px;max-width:60%"/>
</p>

When attempting to measure small remaining distances by eye, any distance smaller than this limit will be difficult to distinguish. As the rope length is progressively reduced, the remaining error becomes too small for the eye to discern accurately.

## General Limitations

Talking about the successive approximation method generally, this algorithm is simple to implement and efficient for moderate precision needs. It handles large ranges and discrete steps, with low computational and memory demands, making it suitable for real-world tasks where exact precision isn't necessary.

While effective in many scenarios, this method has certain limitations. Here are some key limitations:

- **Convergence**: Slow for some inputs, limited by a fixed number of iterations.
- **Precision**: Dependent on a fixed error threshold, which may not be ideal for all situations.
- **Scale**: Relies on a fixed scale, which might not be optimal for different ranges of values.
- **Floating-Point Precision**: Limited precision when dealing with very large or very small values.
- **Complexity**: Not suitable for problems requiring high precision, multi-dimensional spaces, or non-smooth functions.

Despite these limitations, this method is still useful in specific contexts where approximate values are acceptable and precision requirements are not too stringent. For more complex cases, more sophisticated techniques may be necessary.

## Broader Implications

The iterative approximation methods seen here could be applied in any scenario where:

- A precise value needs to be approximated with predefined units or tolerances.
- Efficiency and simplicity are prioritized over absolute precision.
- Systems must operate within resource constraints or rounding errors, like in hardware devices, video games, and network systems.

The key is that the approximation process ensures you get as close as possible to the desired value without overshooting or unnecessary complexity. The stepwise refinement, especially the diminishing step size, is useful in scenarios where fine-tuned adjustments are needed but with bounds on precision or computational limits.
