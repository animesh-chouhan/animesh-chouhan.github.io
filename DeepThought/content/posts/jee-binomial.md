## Problem

Today, we will examine a problem that appeared in JEE Advanced 2016, specifically in Paper I as problem number 51 in the Part III: Mathematics section. You can find the official question paper linked [here](https://jeeadv.ac.in/past_qps/2016_1.pdf).

Now, let's dive into the problem:

Converting the problem to LaTeX:

Let \\( m \\) be the smallest positive integer such that the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the expansion of $$ (1+x)^{2}+(1+x)^{3}+\cdots+(1+x)^{49}+(1+mx)^{50} $$ is \\( (3n+1)^{51}C\_{3} \\) for some positive integer n. Then the value of \\( n \\) is

## Binomial Theorem

The binomial theorem is a mathematical formula that expresses the expansion of a power of the sum of two numbers. It states that the expansion of \\( (a+b)^n \\) can be expressed as a sum of terms, each of which is the product of a binomial coefficient and powers of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).

The binomial coefficient, denoted by \\( {n \choose k} \\), is the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) objects from a set of \\( n \\) objects. The formula for the binomial theorem is:

$$(a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} a^{n-k} b^k$$

where \\( {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).

### Special case

For the expansion of \\( (1+mx)^n \\), \\( a=1 \\) and \\( b=mx \\), the binomial theorem becomes:

$$(1+mx)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} 1^{n-k} (mx)^k$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$(1+mx)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} m^k x^k$$

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( x^k \\) in the expansion of \\( (1+mx)^n \\) is \\( {n \choose k} (m^k) \\).

## Python Implementation

Let's try to implement a recursive solution which doesn't assume the knowledge of binomial theorem.

We have to compute the coefficient of \\( x^p \\) in \\( (1 + mx)^n \\). We have,

$$(1+mx)^n = (1+mx)^{n-1} \cdot (1+mx)$$

**Recursive Case**:

- The coefficient for \\( x^p \\) in \\( (1 + mx)^n \\) can be computed by summing:
  - The coefficient of \\( x^p \\) in \\( (1 + mx)^{n-1} \\)
  - The coefficient of \\( x^{p-1} \\) in \\( (1 + mx)^{n-1} \\) multiplied by \\( m \\)

**Base Cases**:

- If \\( p == 0 \\), the coefficient is \\( 1 \\) (the constant term).
- If \\( p > n \\), the coefficient is \\( 0 \\) (there aren't enough \\( x \\) terms).
- If \\( p == n \\), the coefficient is \\( m^n \\) (the case where all terms are \\( x \\)).

Here's how we can implement it in Python:

```python
# Coeff of x^p in (1+mx)^n

def coeff(m, n, p):
    if p == 0:
        return 1
    elif p > n:
        return 0
    elif p == n:
        return pow(m, n)
    return coeff(m, n - 1, p) + m * coeff(m, n - 1, p - 1)


print(coeff(1, 2, 0))
print(coeff(1, 2, 1))
print(coeff(1, 2, 2))
```

</br>

As \\( (1+x)^2 = 1 + 2 \cdot x + x^2 \\) the output is:

```sh
1
2
1
```

### Optimizations

Experienced competitive programmers reading this code would be smelling exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems. Let's put a dirty one-liner hotfix to resolve this:

```python
# Optimized coeff of x^p in (1+mx)^n
import functools

@functools.cache
def coeff(m, n, p):
    if p == 0:
        return 1
    if p > n:
        return 0
    elif p == n:
        return pow(m, n)
    return coeff(m, n - 1, p) + m * coeff(m, n - 1, p - 1)

```

Better? We can improve further by implementing this using an iterative approach but this would suffice for now.

</p>

#### Using `math.comb()` to find the coefficient

We can also take advantage of the binomial theorem to get the coefficient. Here's how:

As the coefficient of \\( x^k \\) in the expansion of \\( (1+mx)^n \\) is given by \\( {n \choose k} (m^k) \\).

```python
# Coeff of x^p in (1+mx)^n
from math import comb

def coeff_binomial(m, n, p):
    if p > n:
        return 0
    return comb(n, p) * pow(m, p)
```

## Solution

Enough with the fun! Now that we have an efficient coefficient function, let's get the problem out of the way. We had the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the expansion of:

$$ (1+x)^{2}+(1+x)^{3}+\cdots+(1+x)^{49}+(1+mx)^{50} = (3n+1)^{51}C\_{3} $$

where \\( m, n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\\) and minimize m.

Let's calculate the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the expansion leaving the last term as \\( m \\) is currently unknown:

```python
from math import comb

coeff_x2 = sum([coeff(1, i, 2) for i in range(2, 50)])
c_51_3 = comb(51, 3)
```

We also calculate \\( {51}C\_{3} \\) which will come in handy soon. Now let's brute search for m starting from 1. If you have made it this far then the code should be self-explanatory.

```python
for m in range(1, 100):
    lhs = coeff_x2 + coeff(m, 50, 2)

    if lhs % c_51_3 == 0:
        quotient = lhs // c_51_3
        if quotient % 3 == 1 and quotient // 3 != 0:
            n = (quotient - 1) // 3
            print(f"Answer is: {n}")
            break

```

### Output

```sh
animesh@pop-os:~$ python -u "/home/animesh/jee.py"
Answer is: 5
```

The answer indeed is 5 and luckily the problem isn't that difficult even when solving using pen/paper. Give it a try!

## Conclusion

Although using a programming language seems fun for solving these types of problems, pen-and-paper methods are often more effective for standard problems. Working on JEE problems with Python can enhance your understanding of both programming and mathematical concepts <span class="chart">üòâ</span>
